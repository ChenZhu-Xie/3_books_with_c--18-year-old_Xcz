## Description
* Three e-books written in my freshman year
    * have freely explored mathematics (geometry & algebra), physics, and programming
    * generated through Word_2_Pdf :sweat_smile:...
    * the 2nd book[『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/tree/master/2.『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』(C++).pdf)contains [C++ codes](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/tree/master/cpp_codes_for_book2『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』).

* 『[Book 2](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/tree/master/2.『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』(C++).pdf)』's『Partitions: 1+6= 2+5= ...= 7』related『Sections』
    * [![fig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/master/img/book_2-5.png "全正系数多元一次不定方程的非负整数解.cpp")](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/tree/master/cpp_codes_for_book2『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』/5.全正系数多元一次不定方程的非负整数解.cpp "5.全正系数多元一次不定方程的非负整数解.cpp")
* 『[Book 1](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/tree/master/1.『The_Frequencies_of_Nature』.pdf)』's『Multinomial theorem』related『Sections』
    * [![fig](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/raw/master/img/book_2-4.png "多项式定理中的计组合数问题.cpp")](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/tree/master/cpp_codes_for_book2『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』/3.多项式定理中的计组合数问题.cpp "3.多项式定理中的计组合数问题.cpp")
    * The process in fig above is similiar to [Electronic hourglass](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yj411o7Hf)

## Inplementation
1. Open the folder "[cpp_codes_for_book2『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp/tree/master/cpp_codes_for_book2『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』)".
2. Run any of the 12 programs inside using Visual C++ 6.0, to be more precise, 
    * using `Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6.0\Common\MSDev98\Bin\MSDEV.EXE`.
    * [VC6.0 Download & Setup](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6YNbpj6RlCNh9zZd5K1wQA) ; Higher version of C++ is recommended, but may not be able to run this project?

## History
* These 👉 [three e-books](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp) were written
    * (Personal time) by 18~19-year-old little Xie
        * 18-year-&-6-month-old to 19-year-&-4-month-old 
    * (Personal stage) in grades 1-2 of undergraduate studies
        * First year of undergraduate (Enrollment until the start of sophomore year)
    * (World time) approximately during 2016-2017
        * 2016.10 - 2016.12 - 2017.08
